# Java-Compiler
This code is a simple compiler that reads a code file, tokenizes its contents, and displays the resulting tokens in a table. It defines a class called Compiler that contains several static methods for performing these tasks. The readCodeFromFile method reads the contents of the file and returns a list of lines, while the tokenize method takes a list of lines and converts them into a list of Token objects. The displayTokensInTable method takes a list of Token objects and displays them in a graphical table using Java Swing. The main method calls these methods in sequence to read the code, tokenize it, and display the resulting tokens.
